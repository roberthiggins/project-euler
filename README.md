project-euler
=============

My attempts at project euler problems. Suggestions welcome.

Solutions can be in any language. If the solution requires more than a single file then all required files should be in a sub-directory.

Solution naming should be of the form [Pp][Ee]uler[0-9]+. In the case of a sub-dir the top dir should have this name format as should be the file containing main.
